<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>

<!-- MOVIE 1 -->
<a class="movie-btn" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Hangover+movie">
  The Hangover
</a>
<p>
"The Hangover" is one of the funniest and most unpredictable comedy films ever made.  
It follows a group of friends who go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, only to wake up the next morning with absolutely no memory of the night before.  
The movie is filled with crazy events, unexpected surprises, and hilarious moments.  
Every character adds a unique flavor to the story, making the entire movie feel like a thrilling, chaotic adventure.  
I love it because it’s not just comedy — it’s an experience.
</p>

<!-- MOVIE 2 -->
<a class="movie-btn" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fight+Club+movie">
  Fight Club
</a>
<p>
"Fight Club" is a powerful and mind-blowing film that explores identity, freedom, masculinity, and the chaos of modern life.  
Brad Pitt absolutely dominates the screen with his iconic portrayal of Tyler Durden — stylish, rebellious, and unforgettable.  
The movie challenges your way of thinking and keeps surprising you until the very end.  
It's one of those films that you keep thinking about long after it's over.  
That's why it's one of my personal favorites.
</p>

<!-- MOVIE 3 -->
<a class="movie-btn" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Bhaag+Milkha+Bhaag+movie">
  Bhaag Milkha Bhaag
</a>
<p>
"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag" is an inspiring masterpiece based on the real-life journey of Indian athlete Milkha Singh.  
The movie beautifully shows his struggles, childhood trauma, hard work, dedication, and his rise to becoming one of the greatest runners in India.  
Farhan Akhtar's transformation and acting are absolutely outstanding.  
It's a film that motivates you to push your limits and chase greatness, no matter how tough life gets.  
Truly one of the best motivational Bollywood movies of all time.
