  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>
  
  <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Anshuman Parihar</strong>, a passionate Web Developer who loves building creative and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
  <p>I started my coding journey by learning C and Python, and soon discovered my love for front-end development. Now, I’m working on improving my design sense, mastering CSS animations, and creating projects that not only look good but perform great.</p>
  <p>My goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer, work with inspiring people, and contribute to impactful tech projects worldwide.</p>
  <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring design ideas, listening to music, or watching sci-fi movies.</p>
